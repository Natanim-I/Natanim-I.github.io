                I hail from Ethiopia, specifically from the vibrant city of
                Mizan Teferi, nestled within the lush landscapes and rich
                cultural tapestry of this East African nation. Ethiopia, often
                referred to as the "cradle of civilization," boasts a history
                that stretches back millennia, with its roots deeply entrenched
                in ancient traditions and a heritage that encompasses diverse
                ethnicities, languages, and religions. Renowned for its stunning
                landscapes, including the breathtaking Simien Mountains and the
                Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia also holds a unique distinction as
                the only African country never to be colonized, a testament to
                its resilience and strength throughout history. Its rich
                cuisine, highlighted by injera (a sourdough flatbread) and
                aromatic spices, captivates the senses, while its deeply
                ingrained cultural practices, such as traditional music, dance,
                and coffee ceremonies, showcase the warmth and hospitality of
                its people.

                Towards the close of 2022, I embarked on a new chapter of my
                life by journeying to the United States. This transition marked
                a significant milestone, opening doors to diverse opportunities
                and experiences. The move from the enchanting landscapes and
                bustling streets of Mizan Teferi to the dynamic and culturally
                diverse environment of the United States has been a
                transformative experience, one filled with the excitement of
                embracing new perspectives, learning, and contributing to this
                melting pot of cultures. As I navigate this new terrain, I carry
                with me the rich heritage and cherished values instilled in me
                from my Ethiopian upbringing, blending them with the newfound
                experiences and knowledge gained in this land of boundless
                possibilities.

                Engaging in a diverse array of hobbies has always been an
                essential part of my life, where I find joy and fulfillment. At
                the core of my recreational pursuits lies an immense passion for
                soccerâ€”whether it's relishing the thrill of watching captivating
                matches or lacing up my own cleats and taking to the field. The
                blend of strategy, teamwork, and exhilaration inherent in the
                game never fails to captivate me. Beyond the soccer pitch, I
                find solace and adventure in the great outdoors, particularly in
                the tranquility of hiking and exploring mountains. The allure of
                scaling peaks and immersing myself in nature's awe-inspiring
                beauty fuels my spirit, offering moments of introspection and a
                deep appreciation for the world's natural wonders. There's a
                unique sense of accomplishment and rejuvenation that comes with
                each trek, making these outdoor escapades an integral part of my
                life's tapestry.

            My academic journey has been defined by a commitment to exploring
            the realms of technology and software engineering. Beginning in
            2018, I embarked on an enriching educational expedition at Addis
            Ababa Science and Technology University, where I pursued a
            comprehensive four-year Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.
            During this time, I delved into a spectrum of coursework that honed
            my technical prowess while actively engaging in internships and
            collaborative team projects. Graduating in 2022 was a momentous
            achievement, marking the culmination of my undergraduate studies.
            Eager to further expand my knowledge and expertise, I've now set my
            sights on advancing my education. Presently, I'm immersed in the
            vibrant academic landscape of Boston University, pursuing a Master's
            degree in Software Development. This pursuit signifies not just a
            continuation but an elevation of my dedication to mastering the
            intricacies of software engineering in a dynamic, global setting.
